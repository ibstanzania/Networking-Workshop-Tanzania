    <h2>About Us</h2>
    <p>
Since 2022, the International Biometric Society (IBS) Tanzania Region has been empowering researchers and data professionals in Tanzania through its <b> Statistical Application in R </b> workshop series. 

      <b>  The 2025 workshop is designed to equip stakeholders working with routine HIV/AIDS and cancer data with practical skills in data management and analysis, while also creating opportunities to network with national and international experts.</b>
        
    </p>
    <p>
 The call for the first workshop in this series is now open.
   
    
  
        By the end of this year workshop, participants are expected to:
    </p>
    <p>
        <p>  </p>
    
<ul style="list-style-type:disc;">
<li>	Critically evaluate analytical methods for use in epidemiological and clinical research.  </li>
    <li>	Methods and apply data linkage, processing, and documentation techniques using R and Python software to improve the quality and usability of routinely collected HIV/AIDS and cancer datasets. </li>
<li>	Implement survival analysis methods for health outcomes research using electronic health records data.  </li>
<li>	Conduct joint modelling approaches in R to analyse longitudinal and time-to-event data. </li>
<li>	Handle missing data appropriately using advanced statistical techniques.  </li>    
<li>	Acquire basic skills for reproducible research using R Markdown and version control (GIT) with application to routine data, research projects, and other relevant areas.  </li>
    <li>	Engage in professional networking with peers, national institutions, and international experts to foster future collaborations in data science and public health research in Tanzania and beyond.  </li> 
</ul>



 
IBS Tanzania warmly welcome researchers with diverse academic and professional background who are eager to advance their skills in using open-source statistical software R and Python for analysing routine HIV/AIDS and cancer data.
<b>To fully benefit from the workshop, participants should bring a personal laptop with the required software pre-installed, as detailed in the Download section.</b>
