    <h2>About Us</h2>
<p>
Since 2022, the International Biometric Society (IBS) Tanzania Region has been empowering statisticians and data professionals in Tanzania through its <strong>Statistical Application in R</strong> workshop series. 
</p>

<p>
The call to the third workshop is now open. It is designed to equip stakeholders working with routine HIV/AIDS and cancer data with practical skills in data management and analysis, while also creating opportunities to network with national and international experts.
</p>

<p>
Join us for four days of dynamic presentations led by Tanzanian statisticians and data scientists, complemented by three exclusive talks from our esteemed international speakers. This year, we are excited to welcome <a href="https://www.wits.ac.za/people/academic-a-z-listing/n/justinenasejjewitsacza/" target="_blank">Dr. Justine Nasejje</a>  and <a href="https://profiles.warwick.ac.uk/search?type=user&v=Edmund%20Njeru%20Njagi" target="_blank">Dr. Edmund Njeru Njagi</a>, bringing global expertise to our workshop in HIV/AIDS and cancer data analysis.
</p>

<p>By the end of the workshop, participants are expected to:</p>

    
<ul style="list-style-type: disc; margin-left: 20px; padding-left: 20px;">
    <li>Critically evaluate analytical methods for use in epidemiological and public health research.</li>
    <li>Apply data linkage, processing, and documentation techniques using R and Python to improve the quality and usability of routinely collected HIV/AIDS and cancer datasets.</li>
    <li>Implement survival analysis methods for health outcomes research using electronic health records data.</li>
    <li>Conduct joint modelling approaches in R to analyse longitudinal and time-to-event data.</li>
    <li>Handle missing data appropriately using advanced statistical techniques.</li>
    <li>Acquire basic skills for reproducible research using R Markdown and version control (GIT), with application to routine data, research projects, and other relevant areas.</li>
    <li>Engage in professional networking with peers, national institutions, and international experts to foster future collaborations in data science and public health research in Tanzania and beyond.</li>
</ul>


 
<p>
We warmly welcome researchers with diverse academic and professional backgrounds who are eager to advance their skills in using open-source statistical software R and Python for analysing routine HIV/AIDS and cancer data. 
<strong>To fully benefit from the workshop, participants should bring a personal laptop with the required software pre-installed, as detailed in the Download section.</strong>
